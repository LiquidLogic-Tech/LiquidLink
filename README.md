## Unlocking Revenue Potential

Weâ€™ve extended the possible features to our profile NFT on contract side and build the all-in-one Defi tool platform to highlight the role of the profile Soul Bond NFT.

Instead of tracking the point for each protocol, from now on, each NFT can allow storing kinds of assets, recording customized data for each protocol & different assets, and supporting social-related activities.

- Profile
  - Each address can only have a single unique profile NFT as a Soul Bond NFT.
  - Bounded with your bios and multiple social links.
- POP ( Protocol Owned Points )
  - Each protocol can set up its desired & customized data schema for each profile and quantify these actions off-chain as a point system.
  - Each points under different category is handled separately and internally, meaning points generated from different protocols is untouchable, only registered protocol and profile owner can modify the data & consume the point. This design guarantees the security, decentralization, and ownership of points.
- Assets Management
  - Each profile NFT can be topped up with diverse assets to compatible with future possible features
- SocialFi Element
  - Different profile NFTs can be granted with different relationships to support future social features such as following & referral.
